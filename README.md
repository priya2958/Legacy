# Prompts
Create a legacy React app to the latest version while ensuring backward compatibility and minimal downtime.

Requirements 
Update deprecated React code and third-party libraries 
Handle breaking changes without breaking legacy features 
Implement feature flags to gradually roll out new components

### How My Code Meets the Requirements:

Updated Deprecated Code**: Replaced class components and old lifecycle methods with hooks.
Handled Breaking Changes**: Upgraded third-party libraries and handled version mismatches.
Feature Flags**: Added flag-based rendering to toggle between old and new components.
Minimal Downtime Strategy**: All legacy components retained during rollout for smooth transition.
